## Project Overview

This project analyzes PhonePe Pulse data to gain insights into user engagement and transaction trends across India. It explores data points like transaction volumes, device usage, and demographic details at both the state and district levels.

## Goals

- **Transaction Analysis:** Understand transaction patterns and volumes across different states and districts.
- **User Segmentation:** Analyze user behavior based on geographic distribution and transaction categories.
- **Device Data Analysis:** Explore the device types used by PhonePe users and their transaction preferences.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pandas**: For handling dataframes and data cleaning.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Excel**: Data was sourced and pre-processed using Excel sheets.

## Dataset

The dataset comprises multiple sheets of transactional and user data, including:
- **State-wise Transaction Data**: Contains data on transaction volumes, types, and user demographics for each state.
- **District-wise Transaction Data**: More granular data showing transaction patterns at the district level.
- **Device Data**: Information about the types of devices being used by PhonePe users.

## Analysis and Findings

### State-wise Transactions
- The dataset was used to analyze state-level transaction patterns, identifying key states with high transaction volumes and user engagement.

### District-level Transactions
- Granular analysis at the district level to observe localized patterns and trends in PhonePe usage.

### Device Data Insights
- The analysis explored the distribution of devices used for PhonePe transactions and how they relate to transaction volumes.

## Conclusion

- **High User Engagement in Key States:** Certain states showed significantly higher transaction volumes, suggesting stronger digital payment adoption in those regions.
- **Device Usage Trends:** A clear correlation between device types and transaction behaviors was observed, providing insights into user preferences.

## Future Work

- **Predictive Analysis**: Use machine learning to predict future transaction volumes based on historical data.
- **Real-Time Dashboard**: Develop a dashboard for real-time tracking of PhonePe transactions and user statistics.
